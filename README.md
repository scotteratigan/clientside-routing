# clientside-routing

The key to client-side routing is the history.pushState() API. More info here:

This allows you to update the displayed URL on a browser without re-loading the content.

To test this out, clone this repo, then `git checkout 1` and then serve the content locally. I recommend VS Code's Live Share Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare
